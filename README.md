# DBMA: DBSA Project 2
This project is done under the BDMA first semester at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles


## Overview
Create a PostgreSQL (Postgres) extension that provides a Uniform Resource Locator URL data type. A URL represents a
pointer to a "resource" on the World Wide Web. A resource can be something as simple as a file or a directory, or it can be a
reference to a more complicated object, such as a query to a database or to a search engine. A URL has a structure, which is
standardized by W3C.

The goal of this project is to create an equivalent type to java.net.URL class in Postgres. More information about the java
class can be found here:
